# Experimental

The [`exp`](./) namespace holds experimental features for the `hcloud-go` library. The [`exp/kit`](./kit/) namespace is reserved for features not directly related to the `hcloud-go` library, for example the [`sshutil`](./kit/sshutil) package has functions to generate ssh keys.

> [!CAUTION]
> Breaking changes may occur without notice. Do not use in production!

When an API reaches a certain level of stability, it may be moved out of the `exp` namespace.
